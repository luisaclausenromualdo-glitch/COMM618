**DHS Assault Cases Spiked to a Record High. Experts and Judges Have Raised Alarms.**

In a collaboration between the Project on Government Oversight's investigation team and the Investigative Reporting Oversight the reporters investigated DHS's assault case filings, a great example of how data journalism can uncover trends that are not obvious from surface-level reporting. 
By analyzing federal prosecution records and comparing year-to-year figures, journalists found that DHS made 274 referrals to prosecutors under 18 U.S.C. 111 in fiscal year 2025, the highest number since the department's creation, and that many of these cases were later dismissed or resulted in not-guilty verdicts, raising questions about how the government is using assault charges in immigration enforcement contexts. 
This article combined government data analysis with qualitative context and it showed both the scale of the surge and the potential implications for civil liberties and prosecutorial decision-making.
