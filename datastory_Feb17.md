**What does 303 billion barrels of Venezuelan oil look like?**

Al Jazeera put together visuals that represent the scale of Venezuela oil reserves, which is the largest in the world. 
The reserves, now controlled by the U.S., are worth trillions of dollars and Al Jazeera gave us an idea of how much 303 billion barrels of Venezuelan oil looks like. 
It's a quick story but with the right amount of information. It was a smart way to helps us understand the magnitute of the oil in Venezuela. I wish they would have explained the methodology in the bottom.
