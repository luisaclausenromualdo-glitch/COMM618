In 2025, a study found Oklahoma ranks 50th in the U.S. for public education. The study analysed test scores, graduation rates, school safety and bullying rates.
Rural school districts serve a large share of students in the state, and geography often determines the type of access students have to advanced coursework.  I wonder if there are courses rural Oklahoma students never get to take. If so, which advanced, elective and career-preparatory courses are unavailable to students in rural Oklahoma and how does that limited access shape their post-graduation options?

There are no datasets showing which courses schools are actually able to offer. A dataset mapping course availability across rural districts could reveal some disparities in academic opportunity that are invisible in graduation rates and test scores alone. 
Gathering this data could show how educational opportunity narrows as schools get smaller and more remote. 

The dataset would look at course availability (AP courses offered, dual-credit or concurrent enrollment partnerships, career and technical education programs, art courses and foreign languages offered), the delivery format (in-person, online), staffing constraints (use of emergency or alternative certification, positions unfilled because there are not enough qualified applicants) and school context (enrollment size, rural classification, distance to the closest community college or career tech center). 

I would use publicly available course catalogs, student handbooks from rural Oklahoma school district websites, survey principals and counselors, request public records for master course catalogs and course cancellation records if available from the most recent school year. 

The Oklahoma State Department of Education website would be a place to start. It would be important to define what rural areas mean in order to go to certain district’s websites. The National Center for Education Statistics classifies rural areas as fringe, relatively close to cities or towns, distant, moderately isolated from population centers, and remote, isolated rural areas.
I could also find the program availability by region for the Oklahoma CareerTech,  which provides career-focused education and training to high school students. 

Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education has a list of districts in the state.
