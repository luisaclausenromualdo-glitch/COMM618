**Mapping obstretic mistreatment complaints in Maryland hospitals.** 
For many women across the world, childbirth involves unnecessary interventions or mistreatment. This project asks: Are there certain hospitals in Maryland associated with higher rates of complaints or interventions like unnecessary C-sections?
The project would combine multiple datasets. State medical board complaints from the Maryland Board of Physicians will help identify hospitals linked to patient-reported mistreatment. If a complaint results in public action, it is posted to the licensee's public information page on the Board's website. 
Hospital quality metrics from CMS's Hospital Compare will allow me to find C-section rates, labor interventions and maternal complication data. I can also find demographic data from the U.S. Census and American Community Survey to capture income, race and population distribution in each hospital's service area.
The final goal is to have visuals comparing complaint rates with C-section rates to examine whether higher intervention rates correspond with patient concerns. One of the goals is to have a map of Maryland's hospitals with complaint rates to show any geographic patterns of obstretic mistreatment complaints. However,because of limited time, I may have to narrow my scope and focus on one hospital in each area.
