I read Austin Koecher's substack every day. 
Yesterday, he published one on how ICE's Dilley family detention center in South Texas tripled in size amid controversy over conditions. 
He pulled the data from DetentionReports.com and found the population in the detention "surged from fewer than 500 people in October to 1,332 as of late January.
Koecher linked a ProPublica article telling the story of children who are detained in Dilley. What was interesting about the data finding was half of people detained are children. 
Koecher and ProPublica shared slightly different numbers and Koecher said "Nevertheless, the total population that ProPublica estimates—1,120 people—is a little lower than our estimate but within a plausible range **depending on when they received that number and how much the facility grew in the intervening tim**
I would have never paid attention to that part before. However,it has become interesting to learn how each outlet or reporter collects data and how they choose to use it.
