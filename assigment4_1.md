Good Afternoon,
Pursuant to the state open records law Okla. Stat. Tit. 51, Secs. 24A.1 to 24A.33, I write to request access to and a copy of I request access to and a copy of all medical examiner and autopsy reports, as well as any associated investigative or death review reports, for deaths that occurred in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facilities between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2025. If possible, please include identifying information such as the names of the deceased, dates of death, and the facilities where the deaths occurred. If your agency does not maintain these public records, please let me know who does and include the proper custodian's name and address.
I agree to pay any reasonable copying and postage fees of not more than $0. If the cost would be greater than this amount, please notify me. Please provide a receipt indicating the charges for each document.
I would request your response within ten (10) business days.
If you choose to deny this request, please provide a written explanation for the denial including a reference to the specific statutory exemption(s) upon which you rely. Also, please provide all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.
I would note that willful violation of the Oklahoma Open Records Act is a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of up to $500, imprisonment in the county jail for up to one year, or both. Reasonable attorney fees may also be awarded. See Okla. Stat. Tit. 51, Sec. 24A.17.
Thank you for your assistance.
Sincerely,
Luisa Clausen
